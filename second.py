# A program that reads in a text Ô¨Åle and outputs every second line. The program
# takes the filename from an argument on the command line.

# variable counter i
i = 1
# variable f is for the file name loaded
# variable line is for reading each line in the file f

# Opens a file moby-dick.txt from the current folder
