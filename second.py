# V1_03 - 2019-03-23
# Minor amendment made to if loop and i variable
# Filename module added and input file now taken from the command line

# V1_02 - 2019-03-23
# Code added to print every second line of the text

# V1_01 - Program created 2019-03-22

# A program that reads in a text Ô¨Åle and outputs every second line. The program
# takes the filename from an argument on the command line.
# The filename has to be specified after the program name.
# I.e. 'python second.py moby-dick.txt'
# Otherwise the program will run on an infinite loop

# variable counter i
i = 0
# variable f is for the file name loaded
# variable line is for reading each line in the file f

# Input file for reading

        i += 1
# closes the file f
