# Exercise 9 - second.py
# Mark Cotter, V1_04, 2019-03-23

# V1_04 - 2019-03-23
# File input changed to use sys.args to callup the reading of the file
# Error check if text filename is missing from the command line input

# V1_03 - 2019-03-23
# Minor amendment made to if loop and i variable
# Filename module added and input file now taken from the command line

# V1_02 - 2019-03-23
# Code added to print every second line of the text

# V1_01 - Program created 2019-03-22

# A program that reads in a text Ô¨Åle and outputs every second line. The program
# takes the filename from an argument on the command line.
# The filename has to be specified after the program name.
# I.e. 'python second.py moby-dick.txt'
# Otherwise the program will output an Error message

# variable counter i
i = 0
# variable f is for the file name loaded
# variable line is for reading each line in the file f

# Input file for reading
